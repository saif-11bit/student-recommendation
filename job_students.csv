My goal was to combine technical analysis, which uses historical pricing data and trends, with fundamental analysis, which analyzes financial statements and qualitative factors, to create more robust stock price forecasts. \nMy approach utilized recurrent neural networks like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as well as random forest models and artificial neural networks (ANN) to analyze time series pricing data. I engineered features from over 10 years of stock price data that captured trends and momentum. For fundamental factors, I incorporated financial metrics like P/E ratios, debt levels, and earnings growth. These were used as additional inputs to the LSTM, random forest, and ANN models.', 'I completed research on emerging facial recognition technologies and co-authored a published paper during my studies at the university. Our paper provided a comprehensive review of the advances in face recognition over the past decade.\n\nAs the lead researcher, I analyzed over 20 research papers on facial analysis and biometric identification published from 2011 to 2021. My goal was to showcase the state-of-the-art techniques and highlight open challenges. I specifically focused on the rise of deep learning and neural network architectures that have achieved new benchmarks in accuracy.\n\nIn my review, I examined how deep convolutional networks can represent facial images in robust vector spaces to power effective recognition. I also studied specialized datasets like CKPlus, DeepFace, and ImageNet that have enabled more rigorous training. Furthermore, I discussed the real-world applications of facial verification systems for security and access control.\n\nThrough extensive study of the latest literature, I drafted the 10-page review paper summarizing face recognition methodology. This included properties of cutting-edge models, existing research problems, and future directions. My collaborators and I subsequently submitted the paper to our university journal where it was peer-reviewed and published. Serving as the lead investigator and writer was invaluable for deepening my machine learning and literature analysis talents. The experience also taught me to effectively communicate complex technical analyses in a research publication - skills I aim to continue applying as I pursue a career in computer vision and pattern recognition.']"

My goal was to combine technical analysis, which uses historical pricing data and trends, with fundamental analysis, which analyzes financial statements and qualitative factors, to create more robust stock price forecasts. \nMy approach utilized recurrent neural networks like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as well as random forest models and artificial neural networks (ANN) to analyze time series pricing data. I engineered features from over 10 years of stock price data that captured trends and momentum. For fundamental factors, I incorporated financial metrics like P/E ratios, debt levels, and earnings growth. These were used as additional inputs to the LSTM, random forest, and ANN models.', 'I completed research on emerging facial recognition technologies and co-authored a published paper during my studies at the university. Our paper provided a comprehensive review of the advances in face recognition over the past decade.\n\nAs the lead researcher, I analyzed over 20 research papers on facial analysis and biometric identification published from 2011 to 2021. My goal was to showcase the state-of-the-art techniques and highlight open challenges. I specifically focused on the rise of deep learning and neural network architectures that have achieved new benchmarks in accuracy.\n\nIn my review, I examined how deep convolutional networks can represent facial images in robust vector spaces to power effective recognition. I also studied specialized datasets like CKPlus, DeepFace, and ImageNet that have enabled more rigorous training. Furthermore, I discussed the real-world applications of facial verification systems for security and access control.\n\nThrough extensive study of the latest literature, I drafted the 10-page review paper summarizing face recognition methodology. This included properties of cutting-edge models, existing research problems, and future directions. My collaborators and I subsequently submitted the paper to our university journal where it was peer-reviewed and published. Serving as the lead investigator and writer was invaluable for deepening my machine learning and literature analysis talents. The experience also taught me to effectively communicate complex technical analyses in a research publication - skills I aim to continue applying as I pursue a career in computer vision and pattern recognition.']"
